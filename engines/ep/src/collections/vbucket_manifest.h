/**
 * Collections::VB::Manifest is a container for all of the collections a VBucket
 * knows about.
 *
 * Each collection is represented by a Collections::VB::ManifestEntry and all of
 * the collections are stored in an unordered_map. The map is implemented to
 * allow look-up by collection-name without having to allocate a std::string,
 * callers only need a cb::const_char_buffer for look-ups.
 *
 * The Manifest allows for an external manager to drive the lifetime of each
 * collection - adding, begin/complete of the deletion phase.
 *
 * This class is intended to be thread-safe when accessed through the read
 * or write handles (providing RAII locking).
 *
 * Access to the class is performed by the ReadHandle and WriteHandle classes
 * which perform RAII locking on the manifest's internal lock. A user of the
 * manifest is required to hold the correct handle for the required scope to
 * to ensure any actions they take based upon a collection's existence are
 * consistent. The important consistency issue is the checkpoint. For example
 * when setting a document code must first check the document's collection
 * exists, the document must then only enter the checkpoint after the creation
 * event for the collection and also before a delete event foe the collection.
 * Thus the set path must obtain read access to collections and keep read access
 * for the entire scope of the set path to ensure no other thread can interleave
 * collection create/delete and cause an inconsistency in the checkpoint
 * ordering.
