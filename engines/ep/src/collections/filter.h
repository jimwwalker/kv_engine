/**
 * Collections::Filter is an object which will be owned by a DcpProducer. The
 * Collections::Filter goal is to ultimately enable the DcpProducer to create
 * ActiveStream filters (Collections::VB::Filters) which do the real job of
 * dropping keys.
 *
 * A Collections::Filter can be constructed so that it is either:
 *  1. A "legacy filter" ensuring DCP streams act like they always did, in this
 *     case only items of the default collection are allowed and any collection
 *     items and SystemEvents are dropped.
 *  2. A "pass-through filter", which means nothing is filtered, allowing for
 *     example full vbucket replication to occur, i.e. every item and event of
 *     every collection is allowed.
 *  3. A "filter", only items and events of named collections are allowed.
 *
 * Because DCP construction is a two-step operation, first create DcpProducer
 * second create stream(s), and between those two steps collections could be
 * deleted, the stream cannot police the producer's filter contents as a
 * collection mis-match due to legitimate deletion cannot be distinguished from
 * junk-input. Hence the construction of the Collections::Filter performs
 * validation that the object is sensible with respect to the bucket's
 * collections configuration. For example, a legacy filter should not be created
 * if the bucket has removed the $default collection. The same logic applies to
 * a proper filter, all named collections must be known at the time of creation.
 *
 * When creating a "filter" two flavours of JSON input are valid:
 * Streaming from zero (i.e. you don't know the UID)
 *   {"collections" : ["name1", "name2", ...]}
 *
 * Streaming from non-zero seqno (you need the correct uid):
 *   {"collections" : [{"name":"name1", "uid":"xxx"},
 *                     {"name":"name2", "uid":"yyy"}, ...]}
 *
